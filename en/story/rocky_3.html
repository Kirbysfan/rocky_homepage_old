                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    In fact, I've been eager to customize my home before moving into the meow Kingdom,
                    however, because of several reasons, I can't do that. But after moving here,
                    these reasons could no longer limit me, so this time, I'm going to give my new home a full
                    decoration!
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    I would be recording them into a note in order to ensure that nothing will be forgotten.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    First thing I'd like to do is paint the whole outer wall into white color before I do anything else.
                    Then, I'd like to paint blue bold landscape lines on the wall,
                    but then, when thinking about interior, I became unsure about what to add else…
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    Then I realized that I was poor at interior designing…
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    I decided to walk around the kingdom for inspirations.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    It was really a nice day outside, kitties on the street are enjoying their life.
                    I was walking on the street, looking around for something special.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    Some of those cats seeing me for the first time was curious, as a male cat with a ribbon on his head
                    is really rare.
                    But I wasn't so interested in them, only holding the note, being anxious about the decoration of my
                    home.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    I was out of the home until sunset, when I was depressingly going home with no modification made in
                    the note.
                    At this moment, even the statue of Meow goddess couldn't help me.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    Suddenly, I paid attention to a little purple cat with a big lollipop, who's not so far away from
                    me.
                    That cat quickly spotted me too.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    "Hi." that little cat waved to me.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    "Uh… Hi." I greeted back.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    "You don't seem to be happy, is there anything that confused you?"
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    "Uh… no" I replied, attempting to get away.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    "Uh... hi..." I said, feeling a little shy.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    "Come on! You indeed have some trouble!" That purple cat said, coming towards me.
                    "My name is Dream Cat! My giant lollipop can help you make your dream come true!"
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    I looked at his giant lollipop with doubt, as I didn't think how amazing a lollipop could be.
                    But I'd like to see how amazing it could be, so I replied him what I was confused about.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    “Well… I'm quite not sure how to decorate my home well, I felt that I'm lacking inspiration.”
                    I said, showing my note to him.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    The Dream Cat looked at my note, smiled, swinging his lollipop, told me:
                    "Don't worry, you'll soon find your inspirations!"
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    At that moment, I felt that there was something magical in that lollipop.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    I looked up at the sky, it's getting darker, but the thing is becoming different this time.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    I saw the thing I had never seen for a long time.
                    It was a beautiful, starry night sky. What's more amazing,
                    those stars seem to be in sky-blue, my favorite color!!
                    Just then, a rainbow amazingly cut through the sky!
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    Such a beautiful scene quickly pulled me out of the depressing mood, made me energetic again.
                    I took out my keychain, with a rounded shaped acrylic yellow star on it.
                    I suddenly got an inspiration. Meanwhile I also thought a new logo for myself: a sky-blue
                    round-shaped star!
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    "Seems that you got the inspiration!" The Dream cat said.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    "Yes, I know, I know! Thank you!" I said excitedly,
                    "Btw, I'm Rocky! You're so amazing!" I thanked the Dream Cat in great joy, and became friends with
                    him.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    I finished the note of what I'd like to decorate, then went home, under the beautiful night sky.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    The next day, I took out the tool I prepared before and was ready to decorate my home.
                    But a cat pass by told me that I can find Lei Er for help.
                    Then, under his help, I took some draft of my new home and found Lei Er.
                    I told him my situation. He accepted my request. Then I took him in front of my home,
                    took out the material I prepared in advance as he required.
                    I took out my note and my draft, asking him to finish everything except interior.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    Lei Er looked at them for a while, smiled, then equipped his hammer,
                    running towards those materials and my house,
                    then swung his hammer, jumped up.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    "Construct!"
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    As he shouted, he whacked right in front of the material heavily.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    Suddenly, all those materials gathered together, shining magically, flying to my house.
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    After a bright light, I saw that my house amazingly became what it looked like in the draft!
                </p>
                <p class="s_indent" id="hw_cont">
                    I thanked and paid Lei Er coins, after that, I believed that the Ya Dian land must be a super
                    amazing place!
                    Later, I spent a lot of time using my tool to finish my interior. At this moment, the house is
                    finished!
                    Now I'd like to take a tour in such a amazing land!
